		<p>Welcome to Brackets ! <br>Brackets is a modded SMP which runs on Fabric.<br> Under this text you will find two links to download the mods<br> The first link is for MultiMC users (it's the whole Minecraft instance)<br> The second link is for regular Minecraft players who just want to download the mods.<br><br></p>
		<p>Installation:<br>
		Copy the mods in your mod folder (.minecraft/mods), then start your game</p>
		<p>Optional:<br>
		Close your game, and after that copy the configs in your config folder (.minecraft/config).</p>
		<p>Notable mods:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> - Advanced Netherite: adds some new tiers of netherite, you combine the pieces with netherite ingots mixed with the other ores to make netherite-iron pieces forexample, or netherite-gold, etc.</li>
		<li> - Create: the famous Create mod, which adds lots of redstone machines to make cool contraptions</li>
		<li> - Charm: this adds vanilla-like features which are nice to have</li>
		<li> - Axes Are Weapons: turns the axes in weapons because by default if you attack with an axe it&#39;ll remove 2 points of durability to it, makes it so it only removes 1</li>
		<li> - Better Than Mending: adds the ability to sneak-right-click a Mending item to repair it with experience you already have</li>
		<li> - Crops Love Rain: makes crops and saplings grow faster while it&#39;s raining</li>
		<li> - Fabrication: some tweaks to the game</li>
		<li> - Leaves be gone: fast leaf decay</li>
		<li> - Plasmo Voice: an in-game proximity voice chat</li>
		<li> - Nicer portals: make the portal any shape you want. You can also make the frame out of crying obsidian</li>
		<li> - Realistic Sleep: makes time go faster (and furnaces and wheather too) when sleeping instead of instantly skipping the night</li>
		<li> - Trade cycling: cycle villager trades with the click of a button (in the villager&#39;s trading interface)</li>
		<li> - Universal Graves: adds gravestones that keep your items upon dying</li>
		<li> - Universal Enchants: allows for mixing enchants for tools, armor and weapons, for example Infinity + Mending, Looting on an axe, Quick Charge on bows, etc.</li>
		<li> - And a lot of QoL and optimisation mods!</li>
